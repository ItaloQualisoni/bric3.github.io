0. Describe the problem

Define : 
 - recursion
 - corecursion
 - thread stack
 - tail call
 - tail call elimination

   Show what is a tail call in a recursive method and what is not.


1. Picture recursion with Java

   Illustrate thread stack for recursive calls

2. Describe programatic approach of tail call elimination using a 
`TailCall` object.

   Illustrate tail call elimination

Ideas
 - [ ] Show VisualVM screenshot for regular recursive function
 - [ ] Show VisualVm screenshot for programmatic TCE
