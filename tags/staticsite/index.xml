      <description>Moving away form Jekyll. Import is easy, but tackling important details (conserve links to article, conserve comments, migrate some jekyll liquid template, theme tweaking deployment) has been challenging sometime.
 Motivation When started this blog in 2010 I went like a lot other to Wordpress as this was the one of the most common and easy way to write and publish something, then I got pissed at Wordpress as it was a pain to maintain and to write code, not to mention the speed, it was bad, then Github announced Github Pages, this was a revelation : articles written in pure Markdown, no database or server to maintain, fast writing, fast page thanks to static files.</description>
